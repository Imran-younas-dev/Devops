**Operating System (OS)**

Basically, two things want to communicate with the hardware:

1. The **user (human)**
2. **Applications** like YouTube, browsers, or games.

Directly using hardware (like hard disk, memory, or CPU) is very difficult. People couldn’t easily tell the computer how to run a program or show “Hello World”.

That’s why the **Operating System (OS)** was introduced.

Examples of operating systems:

* Linux
* Unix
* Windows
* macOS

First, **Unix** was created.
Later, **Linux** was developed based on Unix.

At that time, it was still difficult for users and applications to communicate with the system because everything was text-based.

So, **Microsoft introduced Windows**, which provided a **GUI (Graphical User Interface)**, making computers easy to use with a mouse, icons, and windows.

### ✅ Even Shorter Simple Version (Very Easy)

An **Operating System** helps:

* The **user** talk to the computer
* The **applications** use hardware

Without an OS, using hardware is very hard.

Unix came first,
then Linux,
and later Windows came with a **GUI** to make computers easy for everyone.



We talked about what an operating system is. Now let’s talk about which operating system is famous.
Basically, Linux is a very famous operating system because it is open source and free. Most companies prefer it because it is secure, and the community continuously improves it.
Now let’s talk about Linux contributions. Many companies contribute to Linux, such as Ubuntu, Red Hat, and Debian. These companies add extra features on top of Linux. Among them, Ubuntu is the most popular.

**Using Linux on Windows**
We usually use **Ubuntu**. If we want to use Linux on Windows, we have **two options**:

1. **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**
2. **Docker**

**What is a Package Manager in Ubuntu?**
A **package manager** is used in Ubuntu to **install, upgrade, maintain, and remove software**.

* In Ubuntu, we use **`apt`** as the package manager.
* For example, when we run `apt install python`, it reads the **stored package information** and installs Python from a **trusted source/website**.
* If the software is not available via `apt`, we can install it **manually** or using other tools like **WGL**.

I can also make it **even simpler and easy to remember for notes** if you want. Do you want me to do that?
