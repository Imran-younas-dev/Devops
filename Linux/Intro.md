**Operating System (OS)**

Basically, two things want to communicate with the hardware:

1. The **user (human)**
2. **Applications** like YouTube, browsers, or games.

Directly using hardware (like hard disk, memory, or CPU) is very difficult. People couldn’t easily tell the computer how to run a program or show “Hello World”.

That’s why the **Operating System (OS)** was introduced.

Examples of operating systems:

* Linux
* Unix
* Windows
* macOS

First, **Unix** was created.
Later, **Linux** was developed based on Unix.

At that time, it was still difficult for users and applications to communicate with the system because everything was text-based.

So, **Microsoft introduced Windows**, which provided a **GUI (Graphical User Interface)**, making computers easy to use with a mouse, icons, and windows.

### ✅ Even Shorter Simple Version (Very Easy)

An **Operating System** helps:

* The **user** talk to the computer
* The **applications** use hardware

Without an OS, using hardware is very hard.

Unix came first,
then Linux,
and later Windows came with a **GUI** to make computers easy for everyone.
